## Vortex Rings Simulation
This repository contains a simple Python script that simulates the evolution of vortex rings using the Biot-Savart law. The script generates, updates, and visualizes the positions and velocities of vortex tubes over a specified number of time steps. An example of vortex rings is smoke rings, which can interact in non trivial ways. In the PowerPoint file **Vorticit√†.pptx** you can find the results of different simulations compared to practical experiments (the .pptx file is quite heavy since it contains a couple of videos).
